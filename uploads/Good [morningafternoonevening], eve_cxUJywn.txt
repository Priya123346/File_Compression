Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! It’s great to see you all here today. Welcome to the IEEE introductory meet for this term! My name is [your name], and I’m excited to kick off this session with all of you. Today, we’ll get to know each other, talk about IEEE’s goals and activities, and, most importantly, hear your ideas on how we can make this term amazing for everyone. Let’s get started!"

Please introduce yourself with your name, your year of study or position.
"Along with that, I’d love to hear your thoughts on two important questions: What did you feel was missing from IEEE in the previous term, and what would you like to see or achieve this term? Feel free to share anything that comes to mind—this is your platform to speak up."
